# Asymptotic-Symmetries-in-Curved-Spacetime
Course project for PH 807 : Advanced General Relativity.

I studied asymptotic structure of gauge theories, symmetries arising from boundary conditions, and the infrared triangle.

I also derived supertranslations and superrotations in the Bondi gauge for 4D GR in asymptotically flat and (A)dS spacetimes.
